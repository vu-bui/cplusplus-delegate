This is a part of my assignment at university. The idea is to create an alternative of function pointer in C++ that is alike to C# delegate. It must be error-detectable by compilers at compile time to avoid possible errors that might be really hard to debug. I find it quite interesting, so I upload it here under BSD license for everyone to use freely as they want to.

You can use my code for free without any acknowledgement, but please keep my copyright in the source file :-)
